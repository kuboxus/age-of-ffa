# Age of War Multiplayer - Refactored

This project is a real-time multiplayer strategy game inspired by "Age of War". It supports both online multiplayer (via Firebase) and an offline mode for testing/local play.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main entry point for Online Multiplayer.
- `offline.html`: Entry point for Offline Mode (bots only, no internet required).
- `css/`: Styling files.
- `js/`: Source code.
  - `common/`: Shared constants and utilities.
  - `engine/`: Game logic and rendering.
  - `network/`: Adapters for Firebase and Offline modes.
  - `ui/`: UI management.

## It's AI vibe coding slop :)
